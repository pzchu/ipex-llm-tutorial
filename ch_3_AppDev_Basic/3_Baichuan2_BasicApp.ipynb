    "\n",
    "### 3.2.1 Load and Optimize Model\n",
    " \n",
    "In general, you just need one-line `optimize_model` to easily optimize any loaded PyTorch model, regardless of the library or API you are using. For more detailed usage of optimize_model, please refer to the [API documentation](https://ipex-llm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/doc/PythonAPI/LLM/optimize.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides, many popular open-source PyTorch large language models can be loaded using the `Huggingface Transformers API` (such as [AutoModel](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/v4.33.2/en/model_doc/auto#transformers.AutoModel), [AutoModelForCasualLM](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/v4.33.2/en/model_doc/auto#transformers.AutoModelForCausalLM), etc.). For such models, ipex-llm also provides a set of APIs to support them. We will now demonstrate how to use them.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we use `ipex_llm.transformers.AutoModelForCausalLM` to load the `Baichuan2-7b-chat`. This API mirrors the official `transformers.AutoModelForCasualLM` with only a few additional parameters and methods related to low-bit optimization in the loading process.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable INT4 optimization, simply set `load_in_4bit=True` in `from_pretrained`. Additionally, we configure the parameters `torch_dtype=\"auto\"` and `low_cpu_mem_usage=True` by default, as they may improve both performance and memory efficiency. \n",
    "\n",
    "Remember to set `trust_remote_code=True` when loading the model weights and tokenizer. This will allow the necessary configuration for the model."

    "You can use `save_low_bit` once and use `load_low_bit` many times for inference. This approach bypasses the processes of loading the original FP32/FP16 model and optimization during inference stage, saving both memory and time. Moreover, because the optimized model format is platform-agnostic, you can seamlessly perform saving and loading operations across various machines, regardless of their operating systems. This flexibility enables you to perform optimization/saving on a high-RAM server and deploy the model for inference on a PC with limited RAM.\n",
